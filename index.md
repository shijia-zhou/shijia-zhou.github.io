# Hello, I'm Shijia Zhou 👋

Welcome to my personal homepage!

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the **Munich AI & NLP Research Lab (MaiNLP)** at **Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU)**, where I work under the supervision of [**Prof. Dr. Barbara Plank**](https://bplank.github.io/). Additionally, I have the privilege of having [**Saif M. Mohammad**](https://www.saifmohammad.com/) as my co-supervisor.

I am a member of [**KLIMA-MEMES**](https://klimamemes.ifkw.lmu.de/), a research group dedicated to exploring climate change memes and their role in public discourse. My work investigates how memes can enhance climate change communication and awareness, as well as how **NLP for Social Good** can be applied to global challenges. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specially **meme understanding**.
